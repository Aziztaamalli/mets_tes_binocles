XGBoost Alert Monitoring Model
Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to develop an alert monitoring system based on an XGBoost classifier. The goal is to classify and predict alerts based on provided data. However, it's important to note that the current training data may not fully align with logical real-world scenarios, which could impact the accuracy and reliability of the model. With better-curated data, the performance and practical applicability of the model can significantly improve.

Current Limitations
Data Quality:

The dataset used for training includes data that may lack logical patterns or connections typically found in real-world scenarios.
Noisy or illogical features might confuse the model during training, leading to suboptimal performance.
Feature Engineering:

Features were scaled and used as-is without domain-specific transformations or enhancements.
Improved feature selection or engineered features based on domain knowledge could yield better results.
Model Generalization:

The current dataset may not represent diverse scenarios, reducing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
Next Steps for Improvement
Data Refinement:

Collect high-quality, domain-relevant data with logical patterns and relationships.
Perform data cleaning, outlier removal, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure consistency.
Feature Engineering:

Include meaningful features that are more indicative of alerts.
Use domain knowledge to create derived or aggregated features (e.g., time-based trends or grouped averages).
Hyperparameter Optimization:

Extend the parameter search to cover more combinations or use advanced optimization techniques like Bayesian optimization.
Validation and Testing:

Use cross-validation with stratified splits to ensure fair performance evaluation.
Test the model on unseen data to assess generalization.
Explainability:

Use tools like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the impact of features on the model's predictions.
Key Features of the Current Pipeline
Data Preprocessing:

Features were scaled using StandardScaler for consistency.
Data was split into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
Model Training:

Used XGBoost, a high-performance gradient-boosting algorithm.
Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for better performance.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy and classification reports were generated to assess the model.
Saved the trained model and the scaler using joblib for future use.
Results
Best Hyperparameters:
The model was tuned for parameters such as learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators, achieving the best configuration from the given dataset.

Current Accuracy:
While the accuracy score is acceptable for the dataset used, it does not fully represent the model's potential due to the limitations of the training data.
