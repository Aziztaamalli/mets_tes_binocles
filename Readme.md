XGBoost Alert Monitoring System
Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to develop an alert monitoring system using an XGBoost classifier. The system classifies and predicts alerts based on provided data. The current dataset has limitations in terms of real-world relevance, but with better-curated data and enhancements, the system can achieve improved performance and usability.
